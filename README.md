## About this project

The Pixel Art Maker was the capstone project for the first phase of my Grow With Google scholarship, during which I was competing with thousands of other people to complete the course in the top 10% and receive a full scholarship for the Nanodegree. (Spoiler alert - I got it!) I spent extra time customizing my project for points and just for fun.

#### Dependencies

jQuery

## Project instructions from Udacity:

You create a one-page web application that lets users draw a pixel image on a customizable panel.

To begin, you'll be given starter code (including HTML and CSS) to build the application. You'll write JavaScript code that lets the user create a grid of squares representing their design, and apply colors to those squares to create a digital masterpiece!

Your users should be able to:
- Dynamically set the size of the table as an N by M grid.
- Choose a color.
- Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.
- Your primary task is to implement the makeGrid() function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.

## My fun upgrades:

- Set a theme!
  - Make the grid into a circle!
- Allow choice of background color!
- Allow option to erase or recolor cells!
- Add instructions!
